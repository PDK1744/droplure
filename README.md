# DropLure

DropLure is a simple and secure file-sharing web application that allows users to upload documents and generate download links that can be copied or emailed to others. It was created to make document sharing fast, easy, and user-friendly — with a focus on privacy and accessibility.

## 🚀 Why I Built It

I built DropLure to streamline the process of sharing documents between devices or users without the friction of traditional file transfer services. Whether you're working remotely, collaborating with a client, or transferring files between personal devices, DropLure provides a clean, efficient, and privacy-first solution.
